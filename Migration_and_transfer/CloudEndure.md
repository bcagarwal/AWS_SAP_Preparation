# CloudEndure Migration

- Block-level replication tool that simplifies the process of migrating applications from physical, virtual, and cloud-based servers to AWS. 
- CloudEndure Migration supports any source infrastructure as long as it runs on x86 operating systems supported by Amazon Elastic Cloud Compute (EC2). This includes physical servers, P2V (virtual servers converted from physical), VMware, Hyper-V, and other cloud providers like Azure, GCP, IBM, or Oracle.
- If your source environment includes bare metal servers, and you can install agents (more on agents in the next section), the recommendation is to use CloudEndure Migration.
- You can use CloudEndure Migration to quickly lift-and-shift physical, virtual, or cloud servers without compatibility issues, performance impact, or long cutover windows. 
- CloudEndure Migration continuously replicates your source servers to your AWS account. Then, when you’re ready to migrate, it automatically converts and launches your servers on AWS so you can quickly benefit from the cost savings, productivity, resilience, and agility of the AWS Cloud.
- Once your applications are running on AWS, you can leverage AWS services and capabilities to quickly and easily re-platform or refactor these applications – which makes lift-and-shift a fast route to modernization.
